# **How Can I Request Deletion Of My Data?**

Anonymous or Linked account ID's are stored via Unity Authentication Services. To request account deletion which includes removal of your ingame progress, data, payment history and user id; you can go to main menu on game, select settings -> Account Details -> Delete Account -> Confirm. After that other data related to that user ID will be deleted within 2 weeks. 

If you are not sure or curious about your account deletion, copy your user ID from settings -> Account Details -> Reveal UserID section before account deletion and e-mail to contact.abur.cubur@gmail.com to get confirmation about status.

Remember there is no way to undo this action and after account deletion, account deletion is **permanent** and **irreversible**. **We don't take responsibility of your data has been lost via data deletion request**.
